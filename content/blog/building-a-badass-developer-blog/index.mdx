## Why start a blog in the first place?

When you look at the top performers in your field, the outliers, the ones that you look up to and learn from.
You'll find that most often they share a similar trait: they have some sort of place where they share their knowledge.

It can be:

- A Twitter account
- A blog on Dev.to
- A YouTube Channel
- Their own personal blog.
- A Meetup they speak at
- A Newsletter

The important question here is **why**?

Why should you spend time writing something or creating content?

What's the benefit of doing this?

Here's a list of some awesome benefits:

- **You learn best by teaching**. You can't explain something without fully understanding it. So by teaching you find the gaps in your knowledgde.
- **You establish yourself as someone that knows their sh\*t**.
  Automatically when you see that someone writes a lot about a certain topic,
  this means that they have a deep understanding of it
- **You help others** who want to learn about the topic that you're teaching

<br />

Now you might be saying something along the lines of:

**"the thing that I want to write about already has a ton of articles"**

Your persepective, the way you explain things, the examples that you use, the diagrams that you draw make your blog post unique and different.
Your blog post may be the one that makes a concept click inside someone's head.

For me for example, at some point I wanted to understand what the "event loop" was. So I went through a couple of articles and it still didn't "click".

Until I found this talk

After watching it I felt like a genius. Seriously.

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:75%;position:relative;">
  <iframe
    src="https://giphy.com/embed/ojhAx9NdqUTK0"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    style="position:absolute"
    frameBorder="0"
    class="giphy-embed"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

So don't hold back when it comes to creating content.

<br />

**What if no one reads my blog or watches my video?**

In my humble opinion, blogging isn't about reaching as many people as possible.

nor it's about likes or views.

It's about **you**

You gain the most by creating. You solidify your knowledge and you get better at writing.

If you become famous in the process, that's awesome. But it shouldn't be your goal (unless you want to)

<br />

**What if I'm wrong and I embarass myself?**

If you make a mistake while writing and people correct you, good. It means you've learned something new.

Be open to criticism.

If you find something wrong or missing from this article, please let me know. It will only help me get better.

Hopefully you now understand the benefits of blogging and creating content.
If you didn't, here's a list of developerswho are much more experienced than I am
discuss the importance of creating content.

Now let's see the different ways you can start blogging and the differences between them

## Using a Blogging platform vs. Your own blog

The most popular solutions for starting a developer blog are [Dev.to](https://dev.to) and [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com)

Here's what's awesome about using a blogging platform:

- You don't care about hosting and maintaining your blog
- You don't worry about notifying people who are interested in your content (Notifications)
- Generally your content can be discovered easily since you can specify tags for each post.

Here's what's no so awesome about using a blogging platform

- You don't **own** your content. This means if anything were to happen to the platform or if the platform decided to
  remove your content there's nothing you can do about it.
- You don't have control over how things look and feel. You're limited to what the platform offers in terms of design and features.

Running your own blog is the exact opposite. It's more work but you have more control.

Personally in my opinion, pick what's easier for you. The goal is to write and share what you learn. Make the process as frictionless as possible.

Sometimes developers focus too much on the blog itself and forget about the content.

I realised that I fell into this trap when someone kept asking me about my blog and I kept saying "oh I'm still working on it and adding features"

Don't be like me.

<br />

So let's assume that you wanted to have your own blog and to own your content. How can you get started?

## Options when creating your own blog

### Static Site Generators

Imaging you decide to create a blog today. So you open up your laptop.

create directory called "blog"

create an index.html file alongside a css file

create another html page and write your blog post in HTML.

You'll have something like this

As you can see, the experience is very messy and there's a lot of copying and pasting.

That's where static site generators come in.

In a static site generators you have have a content directory that hols your blog posts, usually written in Markdown, and you specify a "template"

Instead of you manually creating an HTML file, adding the CSS and making sure that there aren't any erros, etc. The pages are generated at build time.

### Using a CMS

### JamStack

Gatsby

Gridsome

### Jamstack + CMS

### Jamstack + MDX

You can start a blog on a platform like Dev.to or Hashnode
try and publish on popular blogs like Auth0, freecodecamp, logrocket, css-tricks, stackoverflow blog, etc.
Hosting your own blog on your own domain.

<Callout variant="check">
  Make sure that when you do this you setup canonical URLs. If you're using
  Gatsby, here's a [plugin]()
</Callout>

## Creating Custom Components

One of my favorite things about MDX is that I have the full power of react when writing my blog posts.

Writers have a common saying called "show don't tell". It's a common expression used to improve one's writing.

Instead of telling your readers how they should feel, you let their imagination do the work. Here's an example:

![show don't tell image](../assets/show-dont-tell.jpg)

The goal is to create an immersive experience. So how do this relate to my blog?

Well it's about making sure that the reader gets the most value of my writing.

If I write a blog post about building a certain UI element, I want my readers to see the component in action.
Tweak it to see what happens and interact with it. I don't want to have only screenshots.

Show don't tell.

Instead of just writing about my experience, why not add an audio version to make my blog more accessible and easier to consume?

Instead of adding more context by using parentheses everywhere (like this). I can have a tooltip component that displays
info when clicked/hovered.

Maybe I want to discuss a book and I want to have spoilers. I can have a spoiler component that hides the content.
This way I don't ruin someone's day

For me the goal isn't just about learning in public. To me it's about trying to craft the best possible experience.
The goal isn't just to inform, but to delight the reader as well.

So that's why this setup worked so well for me. It made me excited about creating content.

### Callouts

<Callout variant="info">This is for info</Callout>
<Callout variant="warning">This is for warnings</Callout>
<Callout variant="check">
  This is a reminder. Useful to establish prerequistes
</Callout>

### Tooltip

Imagine that I want to add something to the sentence <Tooltip content="This is so cool for adding extra context" />

### Audio Player

Useful for making my blog posts easier to consume. Better UX

<Player source={Audiofile} id="mdx-components" />

### Sytnax Highlighting

I can highlight individual lines in my code snippets. Really useful for pointing out important lines.

```js {1,4}
console.log("MDX is awesome!!")

const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b
}
```

## Live Code Editor

This is really nice because It's much more interactive. Try changing `variant` to "info" or "warning"

```js react-live
<Callout variant="check">
  This is a reminder. Useful to establish prerequistes
</Callout>
```
